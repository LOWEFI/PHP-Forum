Pure PHP Forum is the Nahash Group's first registered project. This is an experimental version, so you can use it even if it has a lot of flaws.

This project is developed in PHP and uses an embedded database system based on SQLite.

Pure PHP Forum uses no framework, no bootstrap and no MVC structure, which is why it can be difficult to understand at first glance.

You need to install PHP and the necessary dependencies to use it (apt install php php-gd, php-sqlite3, php-mbstring).

We are not responsible for any consequences of its use, the project is no longer developed because its developer no longer wishes to keep the project alive.
