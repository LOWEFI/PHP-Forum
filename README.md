# PHP-Forum as Pure-PHP-Forum-System

PHP-Forum is my first registered project. This is an experimental version, so you can use it even if it has a lot of flaws.

The necessary PHP dependencies must be activated on the server (apt install php php-gd php-sqlite3 php-mbstring).

PHP-Forum uses no framework, no bootstrap and no MVC structure, which is why it can be difficult to understand at first glance.

The logins for the admin account are :
- Username : admin
- Password : u5*^ZxJ5!qNv%D%Za2Fi9
